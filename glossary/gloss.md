# a glossary of text formatting!!!

### headings
- heading 1 uses one hashtag prior to the text
- heading 2 uses two hashtags
- ...
- heading 6 uses six hashtags
  - headings get smaller with more hashtags
  
### styles
**bold**

*italics*

~~strikethrough~~
  
### lists

### images and links
- links are automatically recognized -- just paste in the link!
- if you want text to have a link: [//text in here is clickable - but this is not a real link!](link)
- [like this!](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51a8L-dlWzL._UX385_.jpg)
- to include an image: ![//descriptive text about image](image link)
![this is an image](https://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/mf_image_16x9/public/istock-146773846.jpg?itok=nWr9VNqW&resize=1100x1100)

### remember:
- include whitespace between items in order for them to be on their own lines (see "styles" for example)
- file must be named with the correct source code for the styles to work (eg .md or .java)
